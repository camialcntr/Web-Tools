          Jack Johnson's big break was writing and contributing vocals for the
          song "Rodeo Clowns" which was featured on G. Love's 1999 album
          Philadelphonic. The song would later become the most famous single on
          the album. Johnson was introduced to G. Love by a mutual friend of
          Johnson who was shooting surf films with him at the time. After
          hearing "Rodeo Clowns", G. Love saw Johnson's potential and effortless
          style and invited him to record with him. That led to the now-famous
          "Rodeo Clowns" recording, launching Johnson's career.

          Johnson spearheaded the Kōkua Festivals (2004–2008 and 2010). Often
          occurring around Earth Day, these six years of festivals provided
          support for the Kōkua Hawai'i Foundation, which is a charitable
          organization that supports environmental education in the schools and
          communities of Hawaii. Kōkua Festival 2004/2005 was a DVD released by
          Jack Johnson Music that showcased the early Kōkua Festivals. He also
          participated, with Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Dave Matthews, Eddie
          Vedder and others, in the documentary Kōkua 2008: 5 Years of Change
          (2009),[26] produced by Brushfire and Three Foot Giant Productions and
          shown on Sundance Channel.[27] On April 17, 2012, preceding his 2012
          Hawaiian Islands tour, he released the live Kōkua Festival compilation
          Best of Kōkua Festival.

          While speaking with New Zealand radio station ZM, Johnson said he is
          constantly aiming to build relationships with local pro-environment,
          non-profit groups. "We try to raise money for a lot of these groups
          who are doing positive things in the community. We try to focus mostly
          on environmental education, just trying to get kids out into nature,
          supporting local farms and things like that."

          At the Stan Sheriff Center on April 14, 2012, during the Pillars of
          Peace Hawai'i: Building Peace on a Foundation of Aloha, Johnson
          performed introductory music before Nobel Peace Laureate Tenzin
          Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, gave the speech "Educating the
          Heart". Better Together was one of several songs Jack performed.

          In February 2017, Johnson announced a U.S. tour beginning in Chicago
          at the Huntington Bank Pavilion on Northerly Island on June 1 and
          ending with two Kōkua Hawai'i Foundation benefit concerts at the
          Waikiki Shell on August 4 & 5. Also, he revealed plans to release an
          album in the summer 2017.[49][50][51] Later, he added a September 10
          concert for the 2017 Ohana Fest at Doheny State Beach, Dana Point,
          California.[52] On September 8, 2017, Jack released his seventh studio
          album All the Light Above It Too, and peaked at number 13 on the
          Billboard chart's "Artist 100."[53] In July 2018, Johnson released his
          greatest hits album "Jack Johnson: The Essentials" in Japan only.

          To coincide with his new album release, Johnson embarked on the Meet
          the Moonlight Tour with 35 stops at major venues across the United
          States (including Hawaii) and Canada. He was accompanied by various
          artists including Grammy-award winner (and personal friend) Ziggy
          Marley.[62] In November, Johnson will tour the album in Australia and
          New Zealand, his first overseas concerts since 2019.

          Johnson is active in environmentalism and sustainability, often with a
          focus on the world's oceans. Johnson and his wife Kim created the
          Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation and the Kōkua Hawaii
          Foundation.[5] In 2008, Johnson adopted the concept of greening
          (reduce and reuse), and donated 100% of the proceeds of the Sleep
          Through the Static tour to the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation.
          Similarly, the proceeds from the 2010 To the Sea album tour went to
          All at Once, a Johnson-backed collaboration of greening charities
          promoting fan involvement.
