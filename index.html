        <p>
          Jack Hody Johnson was born in May 18, 1975 in North
          Shore, Hawaii. He is an American singer-songwriter, filmmaker, and
          former professional surfer. Johnson is known primarily for his work in
          the soft rock and acoustic pop genres.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2001, he achieved commercial success after the release of his debut
          album, Brushfire Fairytales. Johnson has reached number one on the
          Billboard 200 chart with his albums Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the
          Film Curious George in 2006, Sleep Through the Static in 2008, To the
          Sea in 2010 and From Here to Now to You in 2013. His album In Between
          Dreams peaked at number two on the chart in 2005 and again in 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnson is active in environmentalism and sustainability, often with a
          focus on the world's oceans. Johnson and his wife Kim created the
          Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation and the Kōkua Hawaii Foundation.
          In 2008, Johnson adopted the concept of greening (reduce and reuse),
          and donated 100% of the proceeds of the Sleep Through the Static tour
          to the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation. Similarly, the proceeds
          from the 2010 To the Sea album tour went to All at Once, a
          Johnson-backed collaboration of greening charities promoting fan
          involvement.

        <h3>2000–2003: Brushfire Fairytales and On and On</h3>
        <p>
          Jack Johnson's big break was writing and contributing vocals for the
          song "Rodeo Clowns" which was featured on G. Love's 1999 album
          Philadelphonic. The song would later become the most famous single on
          the album. Johnson was introduced to G. Love by a mutual friend of
          Johnson who was shooting surf films with him at the time. After
          hearing "Rodeo Clowns", G. Love saw Johnson's potential and effortless
          style and invited him to record with him. That led to the now-famous
          "Rodeo Clowns" recording, launching Johnson's career.

          Static
        </h3>
        <p>
          Johnson spearheaded the Kōkua Festivals (2004–2008 and 2010). Often
          occurring around Earth Day, these six years of festivals provided
          support for the Kōkua Hawai'i Foundation, which is a charitable
          organization that supports environmental education in the schools and
          communities of Hawaii. Kōkua Festival 2004/2005 was a DVD released by
          Jack Johnson Music that showcased the early Kōkua Festivals. He also
          participated, with Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Dave Matthews, Eddie
          Vedder and others, in the documentary Kōkua 2008: 5 Years of Change
          (2009),[26] produced by Brushfire and Three Foot Giant Productions and
          shown on Sundance Channel.[27] On April 17, 2012, preceding his 2012
          Hawaiian Islands tour, he released the live Kōkua Festival compilation
          Best of Kōkua Festival.

        <h3>2010–2011: To the Sea</h3>
        <p>
          While speaking with New Zealand radio station ZM, Johnson said he is
          constantly aiming to build relationships with local pro-environment,
          non-profit groups. "We try to raise money for a lot of these groups
          who are doing positive things in the community. We try to focus mostly
          on environmental education, just trying to get kids out into nature,
          supporting local farms and things like that."

          At the Stan Sheriff Center on April 14, 2012, during the Pillars of
          Peace Hawai'i: Building Peace on a Foundation of Aloha, Johnson
          performed introductory music before Nobel Peace Laureate Tenzin
          Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, gave the speech "Educating the
          Heart". Better Together was one of several songs Jack performed.
